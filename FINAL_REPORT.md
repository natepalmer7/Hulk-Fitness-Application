### Completed Work:
Our team created a platform for fitness enthusiasts to organize their workout routines. Users can choose a particular muscle group and equipment, and upon selection they will be presented with a curated list of calisthenic exercises designed for that specific area. With our app, users can effortlessly find new exercises to try and build comprehensive full-body workout plans.

Our web application runs on the Flask framework and uses a PostgreSQL database. It has a simple user account system linked to the database which uses a session variable to track the current user. Logged in users can access a calorie calculator to determine how many steps are needed to burn a number of calories that they input. They can also access an exercise search form where they are required to select a body part and equipment. Running the search queries that database and returns a search result page with a list of exercises that fit the parameters, from which users can access exercise detail pages or add and remove the exercises from their saved "favorites", which are stored in a database table. Users can also visit their profile page to see their basic information and a list of their saved favorite exercises.

Each web page is generated by a Flask route which renders an html page using Jinja templates and macros for certain elements. Adding or removing a favorite exercise is performed by an asynchronous Javascript function which makes a call to a dedicated Flask route. Styling of the web pages is handled by external CSS stylesheets which use the Bootstrap library. We also have unit testing for our backend which uses Python's unittest framework.

### Implementation in Progress: 
We are working on implementing a calorie counter for each of the exercises in our database. Currently, the calorie calculator only works for the “Running” exercise. We’ve already written the backend code for a calorie calculator function that will return different estimates depending on the exercise passed to it. We are in the process of implementing the front end code to give the user the option of choosing an exercise, and getting a unique calorie estimation according to their selection.

### Plans for the Future:

In the future, our team plans to create a workout plan builder that will help athletes train like the One-Punch Man. We also hope to implement a mobile version of our app for users who want to use it from their phones. Our plan is to migrate the web based deployment of Project Hulk to Heroku. We will integrate the app with wearable fitness trackers for even further accessibility. Most importantly, our team plans to recruit famous athletes such as LeBron James, Tom Brady, and Kevin Durant as sponsors for Project Hulk.

### Known Bugs and Issues:

A current problem with the exercise search page is the “Body Weight” equipment category does not work. Due to this issue, the exercise search function cannot return “Squats” or “Sit-Ups” because those two exercises require “Body Weight” as their equipment. The “Back” and “Legs” body part categories do currently work, but they’re both useless since they utilize the “Body Weight” equipment. It’s likely that the cause of this glitch is the space character in the “Body Weight” string.
