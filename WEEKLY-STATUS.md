Weekly Status Update 1:

This week, we determined role leads for each of the components of our application. 

- Backend: Danielle
- Modeling: Minh
- Design: Nate
- Testing: Alex
- Front-end: Adam

The role lead will be the primary point of contact and responsible for tactical decision-making within their remit. Each role lead began to build out the Jira board
with some preliminary tasks and items.

Our goal was to stand up a working mockup of a demo landing page with boilerplate text, and preliminary designs.

Going forward, our focus this next week is on:

1. Designing and implementing a proper software development workflow, including formatting guides, CI/CD integration, and artifact definitions.
2. Preliminary database schemas
3. Fleshing out web page designs
4. Further model improvement
5. Defining feature requirements in jira, and creating a product backlog
